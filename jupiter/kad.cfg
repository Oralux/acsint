#		jup.cfg: configuration file for the Jupiter speech system
#		Karl Dahlke's version - keeps your hands on or near the home keys

#		key bindings

#	Here are the straight function keys.
#	Basically, the first 5 function keys read the previous, current,
#	next, after next, and final lines, respectively.
#	F6 through f12 are assigned simple commands.

f1 stmode 1 sline back sline read
f2 sline read
f3 eline for read
f4 eline for eline for read
f5 lcline sline read
f6 toggle
f7 sbuf
f8 ebuf
f9 toggle 1
f10 toggle t
f12 toggle a

#	Left control keys let you interrogate the individual letters
#	 of a word, including case.
#	Ideally you wouldn't need this very often, but you do,
#	or at least I do, when correcting my own typos.

^s back capchar
^d capchar
^f for capchar
^r asword
^w colnum
^e prow capchar
^c nrow capchar
#	Note that the s d f c e arrangement moves the cursor up down left right
#	on the page, in a manner similar to some screen editors or a joystick.

#	Read the last line, or the last non-prompt line.
^n ebuf sline read
^b lcline sline read

#  top and bottom of buffer
^t sbuf
^v ebuf

#	You can assign ^m, and still use the return key,
#	and you can assign ^h, and still use backspace,
#	but I sometimes like to use ^m and ^h directly.
#	Hence I don't move from the home row.
#  So leaving those alone.

#	Don't put the bypass function too far away --
#	you need it for control C interrupt.
#	Or else don't map ^c to anything.
#	or else use stty to establish another interrupt key.
^q bypass

#	Notice that none of my keys locates the visual cursor on the screen,
#	or reads the letter/word/line at said cursor.
#	This is because I rarely use screen mode.
#	If you use screen oriented programs, such as emacs,
#	you can assign new cursor-based functions to the alt keys,
#	or to the control keys, replacing my definitions.
#	To get started, let control y jump to the visual cursor on screen.
#	From there you can use the existing control keys
#	to read the letters and words around it.
^y cursor

#	Right hand control keys move through the words in a line.
#	They can also take you to the start or end of a word,
#	and if you're a C programmer, youKnowHow LongWordsCanBe.

^j sword lspc back word
^k word
^l eword rspc for word
#  start and end of the word, for long words
^u sword capchar
^o eword capchar
#	You can assign ^i if you wish, and still use your tab key.

#	The zero key on the numpad is big, and hard to miss.
#	A good place for the shutup command.
#0 shutup
#	Nearby numpad keys let you look at the words you were
#	in the process of reading.
#  Bottom row words, middle row letters, top row start and end of line.
#1 sword lspc back word
#2 word
#3 eword rspc for word
#4 back capchar
#5 capchar
#6 for capchar
#7 sline word
#8 read
#9 eline back word

#	cut and paste
#  Bottom row mark words, top row mark the entire line.
@#1 sword markl
@#3 eword markr
@#7 sline markl
@#9 eline back markr

# the key binding command isn't used very often, not from the keyboard,
#  bindings are usually done in a config file, like this one,
#  so it can be an unlikely key combination.
+#7 bind

#  set markers in the text buffer, and jump to those markers.
#  Markers are a through z, like the labels a through z in ed or edbrowse.
#  I almost never use this.
+#8 label
+#9 jump

#  clear the buffer.
+#0 clbuf

#  Now some commands to control the synthesizer, speed, volume, etc.
+f1 decvol
+f2 incvol
+f3 decspd
+f4 incspd
^f3 incpch
^f4 decpch
+f5 voice

#  echo keys, and other modes and search functions.
+f6 echo
+f7 searchd
+f8 searchu
#	Note that f7 +f7 begins a search from the top,
#	while f8 +f8 starts the search from the bottom.

#  Hot keys to reload the config file and reexec the adapter.
#  You can use this to reload the config file after some changes,
#  or run the new executable after a bug fix or enhancement.
#  It should be an unlikely key combination that you won't hit accidentally.
#  Thus these are control alt keys.
@^#- reexec
@^#+ reload

#  Dump the current tty buffer to a file.
@^#. dump

#  suspend the adapter, another unlikely key chord.
#  Suspension is per console.
@^#0 suspend

#  test the musical step function, this is temporary.
@^#5 step


#  pronounciations for the punctuation marks.
#  You can give the raw punctuation in ascii or utf8,
#  or the unicode in decimal or the unicode in hex.
#  u969 omega
