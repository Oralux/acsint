You can use these patches to integrate the ttyclicks and acsint modules
into the kernel source tree.
You need to apply the kdsounds patch, then the ttyclicks patch.
Run make config, then build the kernel and/or the modules.
At present, ttyclicks and acsint have to be modules.
If you say y, for builtin, I'm not sure what will happen.
